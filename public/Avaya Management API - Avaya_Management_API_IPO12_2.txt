1 Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document is designed with two objectives in mind:
  Document the REST based Management APIs in IP Office Platform.
  Developers utilizing or wish to understand the Management IP Office APIs

As such, this is a highly technical document intended for the development community.

1.2 Scope
Web Services are typically referred to as Application Programming Interfaces (API) that are accessed via the web (or over a network) and which provide capabilities or services offered by a remote host.

Accesses to web services APIs is provided using the HTTPS protocol and in REST format.

1.2.1 REST Web Services
REST - Representational State Transfer is an architectural style for accessing information on the web. This is becoming increasingly popular and an easier way to access services on the web. In the REST architecture style, information that is available on the server side is considered as resources and these resources can be accessed in a uniform way using web - Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) and the web protocol, HTTP. Since HTTP is preferred as the protocol for communication, REST constraints the architecture to client-server architecture which is stateless in nature. Resources on the web are identified by URIs. Web Services that are created and accessed using REST principles are called RESTful Web Services.

The REST request consists of a URI with parameters. When the IP Office receives a REST request, the Web Service component determines the operation type parses the parameters and performs the requested task. The output of a REST request is either an HTTP error status or an HTTP status of 200 OK with XML or JSON formatted results'.
As REST is built on top of HTTP 1.1, the following table presents a mapping of HTTP standard operations and the corresponding standard REST behaviors.


HTTP
Method
REST Meaning
Details
GET
Query details - result is in XML format
Returns a list or a specific instance of a resource.
Parameters can be passed in the URL of the request
PUT
Updates an existing object
PUT parameters are contained within the body of the request in xml format
POST
Creates a new object
POST parameters are contained within the body of the request in xml format
DELETE
Deletes an object
Parameters can be passed in the URL of the request

1.2.2 Operation Return Codes
The HTTP return codes are an indication of HTTP message validation and server errors. It does not indicate the application status of the request. For example, a POST request can be sent with invalid data in the message body and still return a 200 OK HTTP return code. The application status result will be returned in the message body.

200 OK
The 200 (Ok) status code is returned to the web client due to a successful request.

201 Created
The 201 (Created) status code is returned to the web client when a new object is created.

400 Bad Request
The 400 (Bad Request) status code will be returned when the request is invalid due to invalid parameters.

401 Unauthorized
The 401 (Unauthorized) status code will be provided when the request requires user authentication.

404 Not Found
The 404 (Not Found) status code will be provided when the request specifies an object that doesn't exist.



405 Method Not Allowed
The request method specified for that resource is not supported by the server. The response will include a list of acceptable methods for that URI.

503 Service Unavailable
The server cannot fulfil the request at this time. The client should retry the request after a short delay as indicated in the Retry-After header (nominally 5 seconds).

2 Web Services in IP Office
The IP Office Management API is a set of REST-based services which return results in XML or JSON.

To consume the Management API's a Management API service user must be created. Access to these services requires a session with the IP Office to be created by using the 'authenticate' REST service with an account and password with administrator privileges. When a session has been established, all other REST based Management APIs are available.

2.1 Accessing Management API for IPOL solution





The above figure shows a typical IPOL solution. To access the Management APIs the Primary server will provide the consolidated web services for the entire solution. There will be no need to access the individual node. Authentication for the nodes will be done against the Primary and all nodes must have same

password for service user as the Primary node. If the passwords are different for the nodes, then the Primary node will fail to consolidate the object data and the data from the Secondary or Expansion will not be accessible from the Primary


node.




2.2 Accessing Management API for IP500 V2 solution


The above figure shows a typical IP 500 V2 solution for accessing the Management APIs. The Application Server will provide Web services for IP500 V2 Standard Edition. Authentication will be done against the Shell IPO security Database. Credentials of the service user on the nodes and Shell IPO must be the same.ProvisionIPAddressWeb Service is provided to provision IP address of the IP 500 V2 standard edition so as to access the Management APIs. For SCN solution, the IP address of the IP500 V2 should be individually provisioned on the Application Server.

2.3 Management API User
In order to have access to the Management API, a service user must be configured with Management Service Group access on each system in the solution.

2.3.1 Creating Management API service user using Web Manager
Create a service user assigning the Rights Group Member "Management API Group"


1. Login into Web Manager
2. Navigate through Security Manager->Service Users


3. Click "Add Service Users" on the "Service Users" page


4. Add a name and assign "Management API Group" for the service user.


2.3.2 Creating Management API service user using IP Office Manager
Create a service user assigning the Rights Group Member "Management API Group"



Management API Group Selection





2.4 Data Format

Management API Group Rights

The XSD files are provided with the APIs giving the definition of the XML data structure. Also for quick reference refer XML Schemas for further details.

The following sections provides the request and response structure. Note that many fields are enumerations, please refer the section Understanding the data for further detailed information about the enumeration values for the respective field value in the response.

2.5 Error Responses
Errors can occur at two levels in the API, at the HTTP layer where the request is not suitable for processing by the API and at the API level where the request is received by the API by the API but cannot process due to validation errors.



The API returns the error response in XML or JSON format with the response status of 0, and some more details on the error. HTTP error responses are covered in the section Operation Return Codes. The API error return format is as follows:

XML Response



JSON Response


2.6 Successful Response
A successful GET method for an API will return a body formatted in XML or JSON with response status of 1


XML Response


JSON Response


2.7 Session Services
In order to begin using the API Administration and Configuration REST services, a session must be established with the IP Office. A session is created using the following REST API:

Method: GET

Description: REST service which creates a session with the IP Office.

URI: https://{host}:7070/WebManagement/ws/sdk/security/authenticate

Accept: text/xml
Headers:
X-User-Client: Avaya-WebAdmin X-User-Agent: Avaya-SDKUser
Content-Type: application/xml OR application/json.
Authorization: The username and password are combined into a string with the format "username:password", which is then base64 encoded.

Sample code:

JavaScript



Java
try {
URL url = new
URL("https://{host}:7070/WebManagement/ws/sdk/security/authenticate"); HttpURLConnection conn = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection(); conn.setRequestMethod("GET");
conn.setRequestProperty("X-User-Agent", "Avaya-SDKUser"); conn.setRequestProperty("X-User-Client", "Avaya-WebAdmin"); conn.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/xml"); String authStr = username+":"+password;
byte[] bytesEncoded = Base64.encodeBase64(authStr.getBytes()); String authEncoded = new String(bytesEncoded); conn.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic "+authEncoded);

if(conn.getResponseCode() != 200) {
throw new RuntimeException("Failed : HTTP error code : "
+ conn.getResponseCode());
}

cookies = getCookies(conn);

       BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader((conn.getInputStream())));

String output;
while ((output = br.readLine()) != null) {
System.out.println(output);
}
} catch (MalformedURLException e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}catch (IOException e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}
}


.NET




Result:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1 Pragma: no-cache
Cache-control: max-age=2
    Set-Cookie: JSESSIONID=24121E0F893E7B8A97CACF6A6DEB1469; Path=/WebManagement/; Secure; HttpOnly
Expires: Fri, 20 Nov 2015 12:59:47 GMT Content-Type: application/xml
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Date: Fri, 20 Nov 2015 12:59:45 GMT


NOTE: On a successful request, the response will contain a 'Set-Cookie' header. Part of this header data is a JSESSIONID and SDK-Token which is the session id to be used in all subsequent REST requests for this session.

Alternatively a tool like POSTman Add-in can be used. Following is a sample to access the authenticate request. Similar way can be followed for all the Management APIs.



2.8 Administration/Configuration Services (REST)

Web Services defined in this section for administration/configuration of the system are all REST-based services.
Services described implement a number of administration/configuration functions related primarily to users, extensions, hunt groups and sip trunks.

4.3 Licenses
  GUID- Hex Digit String
oGlobally Unique Identifier that is used to uniquely identify across the system the particular license
  LicenseKey- For ADI licenses it would be the actual license value. For other licenses it will be a license name.
  Source- Integer with value range of 0 to 4
oLocal=0 - The license is local to the IP Office (could be ADI or PLDS).


oWebLM=1 - The license is from a WebLM server. oMappedLocal=2 - License is mapped from a local PLDS license. oMappedRemote=3 - License is mapped from a remote PLDS
license.
oMappedVirtual=4 - License is mapped from a virtual PLDS license.
  Type- Integer value indicating the type of license that the license key represents. The integer value represents a license that is dependent on the Mode. In other words there are different mappings of the licenses depending on the mode.
oIf the Mode is ADI (i.e. 1) the translation list is as follows:
